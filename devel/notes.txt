- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value in _version.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.

- python setup.py install  (make sure this is current)
- In docs directory, run update_docs
- Commit new docs in releases/M.m branch as single commit.
- git push
- Cherry-pick docs commit onto master and push there.
- Now, back on releases/M.m branch...
- git tag -a vM.m.r -m vM.m.r
